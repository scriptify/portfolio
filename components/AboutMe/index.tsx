          My passion for web development was ignited way earlier, selling my
          first website at an age of 14. Little did I know where all of that
          would lead!

          Today, it's my greatest passion to realize complete web app projects
          end-to-end using modern web technologies or just play around with the
          latest and greatest in tech.

          Currently I'm not available for new projects, but feel free to reach
