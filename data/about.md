## _...or my way into programming_

Hello, my name is Maximilian Torggler, and I am a freelance Fullstack Web Developer.

I first came in touch with programming when I was about 11 years old, learning the basics of programming with an awesome sweet little book called "Programming for Kids". The authors of that book even developed an easy-to-understand programming language especially for kids. Since that moment I was hooked to programming. The idea of being able to create something completely new from the ground up made my eyes light up, and still does every day.
By the age of 14, I first came in touch with Web Development. Oh boy, little did I know where all of that would lead. I got myself a huge, 400 pages book about everything Web Development. The book covered HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and basic JavaScript for simple dynamic content. Those were the glory times where transpilers and fancy frameworks weren't a thing yet, and you would just fire up your WAMP server and mess around.
During that time, I hacked together so many projects, I stopped counting. Every time I returned home from school, I got in front of my rusty Windows 7 PC and started building cool stuff: A CMS, an API and a frontend for a Minecraft server (player stats and stuff like that), a forum, some sort of social network (because, that's what every developer does at some point I guess), just to list a few.
Shortly after that, I sold my first, simple website to a local cleaning company. That was the moment when I developed the profound conviction that this is what I want to do for the rest of my life.
After attending high-school (with a computer science focus), when I was 19 years old, I immediately started working for a local tech company ([Crystal Design](https://www.diva-portal.de/)), which creates software for the furniture industry. I was responsible for building client-side JavaScript apps, which was exactly what I wanted to do at the time.
After 8 intense months, I decided to quit and start my own startup with some friends: A platform for local, touristic experiences, much like Airbnb Experiences. I was responsible for the development of the platform. Unfortunately, this startup ultimately failed, and after that, I co-founded another startup, [Photogram](https://photogram.pro), where I am currently the Lead Developer. Photogram takes about 60% of my time currently. In the remaining time, I work on freelance projects or hack on side-projects, as I get bored quickly working on just one thing at a time. It feels like this is just the beginning of my journey, and I can't wait to see what comes next. What I know for sure is that I'll keep developing web applications for as longs as my hands can operate a keyboard, as that's what my heart beats for.

This is a very incomplete overview of my work, and I don't update this site quite as often, so please have a look at my [Skills]() or [Projects](). Hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scriptifyjs) if you want to have chat!
